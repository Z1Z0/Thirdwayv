# Thirdwayv task explanation:

## Architecture used:
> MVVM

## Reasons to use MVVM architecture:
1. Provide weak coupling between View, View state and Model.
2. Allows extensibility.
3. Allows greater testability of view states
4. Allows better maintenance of complex view.
5. A clean separation of different kinds of layers.
